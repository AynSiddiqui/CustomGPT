## 1. Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin building the ChatGPT application, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- A code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Next.js.

## 2. Configuring API Keys <a name="configuring-api-keys"></a>

In order to integrate various services into your application, you'll need to configure several API keys. Follow these steps to configure the necessary API keys for GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth, and the OpenAI API:

### GitHub OAuth

1. Visit the [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) page and sign in or create an account if you haven't already.

2. Click on "OAuth Apps" in the left sidebar.

3. Click the "New OAuth App" button.

4. Fill in the required information for your OAuth app, including the "Homepage URL" and "Authorization callback URL."

5. Once your OAuth app is created, you will see the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" on the app's settings page.

6. Store the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" securely in your project.

### Google OAuth

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in or create an account if you haven't already.

2. Create a new project or select an existing one.

3. In the left sidebar, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."

4. Click the "Create credentials" dropdown and select "OAuth client ID."

5. Choose "Web application" as the application type.

6. Fill in the "Authorized JavaScript origins" and "Authorized redirect URIs" with the appropriate URLs for your application.

7. Once your OAuth client is created, you will see the "Client ID" and "Client Secret."

8. Store the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" securely in your project.

### OpenAI API

1. Visit the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/) and sign in or create an account.

2. Once logged in, navigate to the API section to create a new API key.

3. Copy the generated API key.

4. In your project's root directory, create a `.env` file if it doesn't exist.

5. Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with the actual API key you obtained:

6. Save the `.env` file.

Now your application is configured to use the OpenAI API.

## 3. Setting Up Firebase <a name="setting-up-firebase"></a>

Firebase will be used for user authentication and real-time database functionality. Create a Firebase project, set up Firebase Authentication, and initialize Cloud Firestore.

## 4. Integrating Next.js and Tailwind CSS <a name="integrating-nextjs-and-tailwind-css"></a>

Next.js is a powerful React framework, and Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Integrate them into your project to streamline development.

## 5. Creating Dynamic Layouts <a name="creating-dynamic-layouts"></a>

Design dynamic layouts for your application, including chat rooms, message lists, and model selection components.

## 6. Implementing User Authentication <a name="implementing-user-authentication"></a>

Use NextAuth.js along with Firebase Authentication to handle user sign-up, login, and session management.

## 7. Leveraging Cloud Firestore <a name="leveraging-cloud-firestore"></a>

Utilize Cloud Firestore to store chat messages and enable real-time communication between users.

## 8. Constructing a Responsive UI <a name="constructing-a-responsive-ui"></a>

Create a responsive user interface with components such as chat rows, messages, and model selection to ensure a seamless user experience.

## 9. Testing <a name="testing"></a>

Thoroughly test your application to ensure that all features work as expected. Consider unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.

## 10. Deployment on Vercel <a name="deployment-on-vercel"></a>

Deploy your ChatGPT application on Vercel or any other hosting platform of your choice. Configure environment variables and optimize for production.

## 11. Final Build Demonstration <a name="final-build-demonstration"></a>

Provide a detailed demonstration of your final ChatGPT application. Showcase its features and functionality.

Congratulations! You have successfully built a ChatGPT application from scratch. This documentation should guide you through each step of the process. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the respective documentation for the tools and services used in this project.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this foundation to create a unique and engaging chat application powered by ChatGPT. 

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory where you've set up your ChatGPT application.

3. Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```shell
npm run dev
```

5. Your ChatGPT application should now be running locally. Access it in your web browser at ```http://localhost:3000```
